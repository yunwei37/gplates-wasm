This shows an example of how to use the GDAL API from within a web browser to
display the bounds of a GeoTIFF on a Leaflet map as a polygon. The edges of the
polygon aren't projected, so they will always appear straight even if in
actuality they would be curved. This also doesn't take into account the NODATA
value or masking of the GeoTIFF.

To use, first make sure that `gdal.js` and `gdal.js.mem` are available in this
directory. There are some symlinks provided that will do this automatically if
you build the project from source. Alternatively, you can
[download a release](https://github.com/ddohler/gdal-js/releases)
and place the files in this directory manually.

Next, start up an HTTP server to serve this folder. For example,
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Navigate to whatever port your server is listening
at, and follow the instructions on the page.

This shows an example of how to use the GDAL API from within a web browser to
inspect certain aspects of a GeoTIFF. It roughly mirrors the functionality
found in http://www.gdal.org/gdal_tutorial.html.

To use, first make sure that `gdal.js` and `gdal.js.mem` are available in this
directory. There are some symlinks provided that will do this automatically if
you build the project from source. Alternatively, you can
[download a release](https://github.com/ddohler/gdal-js/releases)
and place the files in this directory manually.

Next, start up an HTTP server to serve this folder. For example,
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Navigate to whatever port your server is listening
at, and follow the instructions on the page.

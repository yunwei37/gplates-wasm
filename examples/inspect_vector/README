This shows an example of how to use the GDAL API from within a web browser to inspect certain
aspects of a GDB vector file. It roughly mirrors the functionality found in
https://gdal.org/tutorials/vector_api_tut.html.

To use, first make sure that `gdal.js`, `gdal.wasm`, and `gdal.data` are available in this
directory. There are some symlinks provided that will do this automatically if you build the project
from source. Alternatively, you can [download a
release](https://github.com/ddohler/gdal-js/releases) and place the files in this directory
manually.

Next, start up an HTTP server to serve this folder using `python3 server.py` from within the
`examples` directory. Navigate to whatever port your server is listening at, and follow the
instructions on the page.
